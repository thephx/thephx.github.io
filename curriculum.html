        <p>The Phoenix is a private boarding secondary school in the United States that accepts 150 students for its class and only has one class per 10 years. The students live on campus full-time and are held accountable for the well-being of themselves, the faculty, and the school. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Instead of conventional classes that teach one subject, we will introduce students to sustainability practices and connect those to education topics (i.e. if we’re constructing wheelbarrows for agriculture, we might discuss mechanical advantage, conservation of momentum/energy, and local, sustainable construction materials). Each interdisciplinary lesson will span a wide variety of subjects and connect them together. Our curriculum will be more focused on STEM-related fields, although we will also touch upon social sciences.
         </p>
        <br>
        <p>Our classroom is ever-changing and always exposed to nature to deepen the students' and teachers’ connection to the land, while understanding that they do not own that land. Although our teachers have a deeper knowledge than our arriving students, they are expected to learn with their students in a symbiotic relationship. Within our program, we will also foster a strong culture of equality that celebrates individuality and creativity.
            </p>
        <br>
        <p>More conventional educational institutions overfocus on the teachers and their needs while sidelining student perspectives. Thus, our teachers will take a decentralized approach where instead of forefronting their own point of view, they engage in a co-constitutive curriculum with the students, offering their insight only when needed. To establish our radical teaching style, we will recruit specialists in their field who are able to take a step back from lectures and instead nourish the intellects of their subjects.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Since all of our experiential learning will be based on interdisciplinary practices, we will not separate our curriculum by departments. Rather, our instructors will teach large groups of students in teams: several teachers from different concentrations will collaborate on bringing parts of their education to a more diverse lesson plan. Granted, there is currently a national teacher shortage, but we will provide these teachers with free shelter, food, and water. Since our curriculum focuses on connecting with and understanding the nature around us, particularly the indigenous plant and animal populations around which the school is built, our administrative team will hire teachers from the local area for every new class of students.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Our administration would follow a democratic and consensus-based decision-making process when exercising authority throughout the school. Instead of taking a centralized approach to control, they take into account the perspectives of all of the students and all of the faculty. This could look like democratic referendums on a specific policy in which all members of the school equally participate. We would also not have a single authority figure in the school but rather a board of 10 people to ensure everything goes according to our mission statement. The large size of our administration is primarily to ensure that power is not consolidated in one person and no one person can make important decisions about the school. We need some sort of hierarchy in our society since we believe that civil society has indoctrinated people into entropy and some control is necessary to counteract that. As the students spend more time in school, however, the systems of power become less necessary due to our teachings and radical reshaping of their minds so they are less prone to disorder.

                <p>At our unique campus, a remarkable tradition unfolds every decade, one that symbolizes our deep commitment to sustainability and community. Every ten years, as the class proudly graduates, our school takes a dramatic turn by setting fire to the campusâ€”a controlled blaze that marks both an end and a new beginning.</p>
                <p>The flames consume the familiar structures, leaving behind a clean slate. After the embers have cooled, we make a profound gesture by donating the land to indigenous peoples. This act not only gives back to the native community but also returns the land to its rightful stewards. The faculty, along with the incoming students, then embark on a nomadic journey, a quest to discover the next location for our school. This journey not only broadens the teachers' understanding of wildlife and ecosystems worldwide but also equips each class of students with the invaluable skills needed for survival in their newly chosen region.</p>
                <p>Our institution's curriculum is built on this foundation of environmental sustainability, instilling in our students a deep appreciation for the natural world and a commitment to its protection, fostering a generation of eco-conscious global citizens.</p>

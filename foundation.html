        In Paulo Freire’s <em>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</em>, he analyzes two means of education as a gateway to liberation from oppression. In the banking system, students must memorize and recite information to their superiors (Freire 58); In the problem-posing system, teachers and students collaborate to build the critical-thinking skills– primarily the use of praxis– necessary to create new knowledge (67). Praxis is a thinking process whereby students “clarify” and “illuminate” their actions (38). Traditional notions of education tend to result in the internalization of oppression which glorifies violence. Our school is uniquely adept at disrupting entrenched modes of oppression and affirming radical pedagogy to aid in subversion. We want to teach our students how to apply praxis to the changes they make in the world around them. For example, if they create a campfire for light, we want them to reflect upon the ashes and smoke they put into the air, recognizing the air pollution they create as a byproduct of the light they receive. If they terraform the land for farm space, they must consider how they might displace native species and disrupt the delicate ecosystem around them, in which they are guests. Our school culture promotes humility and respect for the land; In burning down the school after graduation, we prepare the students to let go of material belongings since we do not own anything, we merely borrow it from the earth. Furthermore, our curriculum is designed not only to prepare our students for environmental sustainability but also to proactively combat the oppressive systems they encounter every day. The Phoenix also promotes traditions and cultural festivals to celebrate equality in all aspects of identity: race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and socioeconomic status. Freire asserts that oppressive systems perpetuate themselves when the oppressed do not get a proper education and cannot identify their situation– hence, the “pedagogy of the oppressed” aims to build such necessary critical-thinking skills (38-39). Therefore, by teaching our students acute ways of thinking as well as exposing them to diverse cultures and individual identities, they may identify and abruptly stop the rise of oppressive systems in their future. Ultimately, our school’s curriculum molds students’ use of praxis within a proactive and engaging teaching environment, so that they may go out into the world and fight such inequitable institutions as sentinels of justice.

        In David Orr’s <em>Earth in the Mind</em>, he emphasizes the importance of environmental sustainability and the distinction that needs to be created between true intelligence and cleverness. The differentiation between the two lies at the core of his argument for a more sustainable and thoughtful approach to our relationship with the world. Cleverness is characterized by “know-how and methods” (Orr, 11), but lacks information about what the <em>know-how</em> is capable of raising unforeseen circumstances. True intelligence, on the other hand, is “long range and aims toward wholeness” (Orr, 11). Intelligence is the knowledge about how to apply data/know-how to the real world. Orr argues that modern environmental problems are rooted in the fact that education teaches people how to be clever but not intelligent, which leads to people making decisions without thinking about the impact it will have on the world. This shortsightedness could potentially result in disastrous consequences for the planet. At the Phoenix, we strive to teach our students how to be intelligent with the choices that they make. This approach aligns with the school's mission to instill knowledge, skills, and values that prioritize the well-being of the environment and humanity. Our curriculum encourages interdisciplinary learning, with a focus on STEM-related fields and social sciences, enabling students to make informed, holistic decisions. By emphasizing evidence-based learning and fostering a deep connection to nature, we guide our students to think critically and act responsibly. Instead of just teaching something that feels somewhat arbitrary like physics, at our school, we actually go out in the world, experience the result of physics occurring, and then connect those experiences back to the theory. Orr also posits that to truly reform and reconstruct education, no student should be allowed to graduate without basic knowledge of the following: “the laws of thermodynamics,  the basic principles of ecology, carrying capacity, energetics… sustainable agriculture and forestry… and environmental ethics” (Orr, 14). Our institution seeks to embody these principles through experiences. For example, our students grow their own food for themselves and their teachers and will learn about agriculture and forestry through this experience. They might also learn about carrying capacity by observing populations throughout multiple years at our school. Our hands-on experiences with real purpose ensure that the students not only have the know-how to thrive after graduation but also the ability to actually apply that know-how to their lives.

        E.F. Schumacher’s <em>Small is Beautiful</em> advocates for a holistic approach to education, whose end goal would be social responsibility and societal awareness. Education without teaching broader implications of knowledge production will never positively contribute to students’ lives and thus calls for a deeper and more meaningful pedagogy. Our school meticulously follows Schumacher’s recommendation for psychological awareness. We subvert dominant teaching styles by explicitly transmitting radical values to our students while imparting them with an awareness of their place within the broader society and how our teachings are applicable to structural analysis. One who constructs a curriculum must ask why everyone already has predispositions and opinions: “Our mind is not a blank, a <em>tabula rasa</em>. When we begin to think we can do so only because our mind is already filled with all sorts of ideas <em>with which</em> to think” (62). The Phoenix recognizes how it is impossible for anyone to truly be <em>tabula rasa</em> through our core conviction of entropy. We posit that human nature tends towards disorder and civil society promulgates the exact disorder we critique by indoctrinating people from birth. As a result, our subversion against society also acts as a subversion against the mind full of ideas ‘<em>with which</em> to think’, allowing students to think freely and create their own unbiased convictions to live by. People, however, never know the right questions to ask when it comes to education, so our school asks them: “When people ask for education … what they are really looking for is ideas that would make the world, and their own lives, intelligible to them” (63). Schumacher problematizes the notion that the end goal of traditional education is making sense of one's life or the world writ large. It would be ignorant to believe that conventional schooling would open your mind to what the meaning of life really is; people strive towards knowledge they can never achieve. Our school never attempts to instill a ‘set’ framework for how students should approach the world but rather attempts to open up new horizons for the students to create their own framework. Every single person is so unique and Schumacher delineates that homogenizing all of them under one lens means that they can never truly be radical. Schools must instead recognize people’s unique qualities and appreciate different perspectives. What most schools completely miss the boat on are the problems of today; education pushes one narrative of the ‘truth’ to uphold modernity at the expense of metaphysical studies, and abstract conceptualizations of reality: “The problems of education are merely reflections of the deepest problems of our age … We are suffering from a metaphysical disease and the cure must therefore be metaphysical” (79). If Schumacher is correct in saying that the problems of our age are indeed metaphysical, then no assimilationist institution will ever be able to remedy them since these institutions provide a single heuristic for all students to approach the world without engaging broader structural questions. The Phoenix, however, does not seek to provide a single heuristic but rather acknowledges that the problems of our age span so much deeper than meets the eye. We agree with Schumacher in the sense that the disease that plagues institutions is one that infects people's very epistemologies and spreads through assimilationist institutions. The only solution is subversion: the cure must start with addressing epistemes themselves; how they are constructed and how they can be reconstructed. This is exactly why our school takes the metaphysical route in terms of education: we encourage our students to explore the material instead of forcing it upon them. The instructors don't mandate memorization or mastery but serve as guidance for the students to explore their own interests and construct a personalized, unique epistemology.

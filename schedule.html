                <p class="student-desc"> This is a sample schedule of a 14 year old student in their 3rd year at The Pheonix. On Thursday and Friday, they will participate in the Celebration of Gender and Sexuality. During this celebration, they will juxtapose traditional indigenous gender identity with modern concepts of gender and sexuality, exploring the rich tapestry of human identity. Until recently, gender has been primarily constructed as a binary within contemporary society. Our school disrputs "traditional" teachings of gender expression with a festival instead of a lecture. This experience is designed to encourage open-mindedness, foster empathy, and promote understanding. </p>

                <p class="student-desc">This is a sample schedule and project sketch of a 18-year old student in their 6th year at The Pheonix. This student misbehaves frequently, and thus disiplinary action must be taken. Diciplinary action takes the form of giving back to the community, because if you do something bad and take away from the community, something equal to-or greater than- must be done to give back to the community. For example, this student caused a food fight during dinner which soiled everyones clothing, so this sudent was then required to do everyones laundry as a punishment. These punishments are not meant to be harmful, but rather to be restorative. </p>
